# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications.  The provided code snippet utilizes `express.json()` middleware, but it may still fail to correctly parse incoming JSON data under certain conditions.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when the request body is not properly formatted JSON or if there are any errors in the JSON structure. The `express.json()` middleware will likely throw an error and the `req.body` will be undefined. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as the server not processing the request correctly.

## Solution

The solution involves adding error handling to gracefully handle cases where JSON parsing fails. A `try...catch` block can be utilized to catch the error and send an appropriate response to the client.
